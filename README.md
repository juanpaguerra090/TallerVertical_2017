##### Descripción del Proyecto
Throughout this week, we improved efficiency and efficacy of the process of getting involved in medical tourism. At centro Médico Puerta de Hierro, there were a lot of steps needed to accomplish this. And not only steps, but also a lot of workforce was involved. So we realized that they needed an application that could provide access to all patients information. But this solution is a two-way solution. It is available for a relation between the patient and the medical team. Using real-time technology we are able to provide instant feedback to the steps the patient needs to do. When the initial request is submitted, the medical team at the hospital receives an e-mail with the details of the patient including his/her clinical history and contact details.  

##### Deploy
The CMPH application was built with Ionic, a framework whose applications are written using web components, and can be published for Android and iOS. The official Ionic page shows how to publish the application on both platforms. To follow step by step instructions can be seen in the following link: https://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/publishing.html

##### Installation
For users, the only thing they need to do is download the application from App Store or Google Play depending on the Operating System of your phone. Once downloaded, the application will be initialized in a login window, where the user can enter or register. Once inside, the application is ready to be used.

##### Technologies Used
* IONIC2 Framework 
* Google Maps API
* Google Analytics
* AngularJS
* Google Firebase

##### Requirements
###### PATIENTS APPLICATION
- The patient can observe in an orderly way the steps to follow for a successful surgery.
- The patient can simply contact the doctor of his choice.
- The patient can locate different places around the hospital, such as hotels, restaurants, tourist places, etc.
- The patient know how to get to the hospital from the airport and vice versa.
- The patient can review their personal information and edit it.

###### HOSPITAL APPLICATION
- The hospital can see the list of patients who are waiting for an operation
- The hospital can see the list of doctors who work there.
- The hospital can update the patient's status regarding the steps that he or she has to follow for successful surgery.

##### Conclusions
This solution needs to include a program of continuous improvement. With this being done, CMPdH will be one of the hospitals with state-of-the-art technology for the interaction between the medical team and patients. The final user will be able to check on his application status and also check any special observations the medical team has to say. The medical team, they will be able to see the status, clinical history and more information for every single patiente they've been assigned to. Also, administrative personnel will be able to check every active patient status in order to be up-to-date with every one of them.
